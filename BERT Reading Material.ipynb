The paper’s results show that a language model which is bidirectionally trained can have a deeper sense of language context and flow than single-direction language models. In the paper, the researchers detail a novel technique named Masked LM (MLM) which allows bidirectional training in models in which it was previously impossible.

    "# How BERT comes and why it becomes so popular ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, BERT has been the first choice to work on solving different NLP tasks. Why it becomes so popular in the NLP community ? It is not just for the being State Of The Art (SOTA) model but also several reasons behind it. The reasons can be differtiate into three main reason.\n",

    "### 1. Limitations of Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "No doubt, invension fo transformer in NLP is one of the most powerful and efficient reserach in the NLP community. It describes the NLP task in a different way for which NLP model can be trained independetly. As a result, parellelization is possible and so the training process becomes much more faster than LSTM/GRU based model.It achieved on tasks such as machine translation started to make some in the field think of them as a replacement to LSTMs. This was compounded by the fact that Transformers deal with long-term dependancies better than LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, it is well designed for the encoder-decoder architecture which ables to solve some NLP tasks like Machine Translation. But there are many more task which does not usse a encoder-decoder architecture just like Text Classification, Sentece Pair task and so on. On those task, how can we use trnasformer on those tasks ? Here, is the limitation of transformer. For this limitation we can't replace LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  Transfer Learning in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is the reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem. It's currently very popular in deep learning because it can train deep neural networks with comparatively little data. This is very useful in the data science field since most real-world problems typically do not have millions of labeled data points to train such complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is used not only for the faster training process but also for buliding an efficient model. In computer vision task, transfer learning is widly used. A robust model is trained on huge amount of image data and find the optimal weights. Then, the model can be used downstream computer vision task as pretrained model. So, adding some NN layers and fine tuing the pre trained model, it is easy to build an efficient model on those downstream task. Some pretrained models are in compuert vision are VGG-16, ResNet, ImageNet, LeNet, Efficient net and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For computer vision we have very good set of well trained models on millions of data and they can be used easily to perform object recognition tasks. We can build robust and very accurate model with 20 lines of codes. Just importing a pretrained model and fine tuning few layers will give us the desired result\n",

    "Though transfer learning is much more popular and widly using model, but in NLP we've seen very less use of this.For NLP, the process is more complicated, because in NLP different text data contains different contexts. So, to use the transfer larning we need a good contextual language modeling.Contextual language modeling means the context of the sentence (for example, *abide by* and *abide in* have fully different meaning though both use the main word *abide*). More better contextual language modeling we can define, more better model we can build using transfer learning. After many research, some good contextual language model was built like **ELMo** , **ULMFiT** which were become popular. But both of **ELMo**( **E**mbeddings from **L**anguage **Mo**dels) and **ULMFiT**( **U**niversal **L**anguage **M**odel **Fi**ne-**T**uning) were LSTM based. In ELMo, 2 layers of bi-directional LSTM were used and in ULMFit 3 layers of LSTM was used.\n",

    "Before BERT, OpenAI introduces their GPT-2 ( **G**enerative **P**re-**T**raining ) model which can solve the problem discussed in previous section. GPT-2 model is transformer based.

    "In the previous section, we've seen that OpenAI GPT-2 becomes able to replace LSTM in many NLP tasks using transformer. Then, one important question arises that actually GPT-2 is able to replace LSTM totally ? The answer is **NO**. Because, while we using LSTM in our task, we can build more robust and contextual languge modeling using bi-directionality. **Bi-directional LSTM** understands better context in language modeling. As GPT-2 uses only the forward direction ( from left to right ), in some case **Bi-directional LSTM** works much more better by understanding better context of the language. So, we could not replace LSTM fully. Now, there araises one question is it possible to build a model adding **bi-directionality** using the **transformer ?** If it could be done, LSTM would fully replaced by the transformer.\n",

For the rest of the Encoder, the word will be represented slightly differently depending on the position the word is in (even if it is the same word).\n",

First of all, to encode anything binary encoding is the first choice. But all we know that all the weight, bias and the others of a NN model ranges from [-1, 1]. So, if we want to use binary encoding for this then we need float continous values to encode.  Obviously , binary encoding of the floating values is much more complex and very much waste of space. To solve thus condition, they use sinusoidal function.   \n",

For example, for **pos = 0** and for **index = 0,1** the fucntion gives us **0,1** respectively which just like the alternative bits in binary encoding. Finally, this posiitonal encoding is summed up with the embedding representation instead of concatination just because providing a good source of features and to store a smaller dim vector.
